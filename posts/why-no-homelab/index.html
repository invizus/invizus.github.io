I even got a chance to participate in designing infrastructure in a new datacentre. That covers the experience bit with hardware. Fiddling with hardware is great part of experience, but it does not require that much time as the software part of system and infrastructure administratrion.\nServers I think that some of the reasons why some folks in /r/homelab do this: either to achieve same experience for their CV/resume, or just as a hobby. Myself, I simply do not have space for that much stuff, on top fo that servers are very noisy and consume a lot of electricity. I like my servers and systems 24/7, that would cost a lot.\nSome time in past I did buy a 1U old generation Dell server and some cheap Cisco switches and router from eBay. They were noisy, not powerful, network equipment was not suitable for my internet setup and I did not have much infrastructure to play with. But I tried.\nServers are good if you need a lot of CPU and RAM, I am talking 50+ CPU or 256GB RAM. Howver, if you only need to run few virtual machines or containers, a modern gaming desktop would sufficient.\nHowever if you still want a rack server at home, you can get below benefits:\nServers can offer more CPU and Memory than a desktop. Imagine you could have 56 CPUs and 256GB RAM? Cannot do it with desktop PC. Hardware experience. In my opinion, HP servers hardware design is amazing, it is easy and pleasure to work with. A lot of business grade servers support hot swappable PSU and disks, hardware disk raid, iLO/DRAC or other remote management. Enterprise or ZFS storage But other than that, you do not need a powerful server for your home to spin up some network management, storage or even a small gaming server. Dell should be good too, don’t have experience with others. Netowrking. If you have few good L3 switches, you could try and setup something like spine-leaf or non blocking redundant nework, and in that case your two interfaces on your server would be useful to setup in LACP mode. For experience, but you do not need this level of redundancy at home. Networking Networking equipment, on the other hand, has different set of features that servers do not offer. This is where having homelab will benefit. Imagine setting up storage VLAN, fibre cables and customer VLANS? Things to learn:\nvarious SPF module types various cabling like fibre, DAC, ethernet Various VLANS: C-VLAN and Q-inQ Topologies like spine and leaf But this tipe of equipment is expensive and you would not do with just one piece to get the most out of it. This is something I would do at my home given the opportunity, unless I do it for clients.\nPatch panels Horrible. I have done some in past. The patch panels with RJ45 keystones from both sides, so you could connect trunk cables easily - these are the worst. I have seen them fail often, downgrading to 100Mbit. Maybe it is just me?\nThe patch panels that you have to terminate at the back with TIA 568 A/B standard, I believe they are more stable.\nDo you always need a patch panel? For datacentre I would avoid, besides in datacentres, with powerfull servers which can virtualise a lot of workload and servers that pass a lot of traffic, Ethernet is no longer enough. You shold consider 10Gbit network, DAC cables or fibre. So in this case, if possible, connect your equpiment directly to switches.\nFor home? Definitely. Go with the patch panel where you can terminate cables behind.\nOther kind of homelab I have seen quite often people setup small Raspberry Pi clusters, small L2 switches. Yeah this stuff is more enthusiastic and fun. Sometimes they can be enough for small services like running a web server, VPN, secure DNS, backups and automation scripts, and so on. These things are also small, not noisy and do not consume much electricity.\nConclusion If I had an opportunity, I would have setup a whole rack of equipment, ranging from few DL360, commodity ZFS storage, or even NVME storage, spine and leaf networking, firewalls, fibre and dac cables, but that would cost a lot of money, electiricty and what would I do with it?\nNot logical.\nWhat will I do one day: few raspberry pi’s and a netgear switch.\nWhat am I doing now: check out my next post about cloud lab.\n","wordCount":"794","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-10-23T11:00:19+01:00","dateModified":"2022-10-23T11:00:19+01:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://invizus.github.io/posts/why-no-homelab/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Roman - sysadmin experience","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://invizus.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://invizus.github.io accesskey=h title="Roman - sysadmin experience (Alt + H)">Roman - sysadmin experience</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://invizus.github.io/about/ title="About me"><span>About me</span></a></li><li><a href=https://invizus.github.io/motivate/ title="Motivate yourself"><span>Motivate yourself</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>Thoughts on having my own homelab</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-10-23 11:00:19 +0100 +0100'>October 23, 2022</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p>A lot of folks in /r/homelab have their own homelab at their homes.
