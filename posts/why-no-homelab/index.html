My favourite kit is HPE DL 360. Not too expensive and is good for general purpose. Good engineering behind it. I also worked with c7000 chassis, variety of firewalls, some storage, switches, fibre optics.\nBut I admire those who probably did not get to experience this and work with such hardware, and we need sysadmins. We especially need sysamins because majority of hosting is now in the cloud such as AWS, GCP or Azure. Or somewhere else. But what happens if we run out of actual network admins, sysadmins of real servers, and so on?\nEven though I did it for living for some time, as of year 2022 I still have some more to achieve.\nBelow are my thoughts on having a homelab and where to start.\nServers Sometimes I see someone is asking online about an old model of server they bought somewhere for cheap.# Software\nSoftware Sometimes a modern gaming desktop can provide much more resources for a small development environment. If you only need to run few virtual machines, learn kubernetes, etc. a virtual machine on your desktop or in the cloud would be enough for such a task.\nThings to learn: virtualisation, fiddle with linux systems.\nThings difficult to learn: replication, network storage, clusters.\nIn production it is important to have redundancy, so you would want to have your virtual machines or containers replciated, set up in a cluster, or maybe even accessed via network storage.\nServer hardware Some old server you found online? Get it, but do not expect much from it. They are big, heavy and noisy, and old models do not even provide enough performance. They are good, because servers can accept a lot of memory and CPU cores. This type of hardware is designed to provide a lot of resources and run 24/7.\nThings to learn: hot swap hardware parts like power supply units or disks.\nNetwork equipment Getting few network switches may actually be worth it and I consider myself from time to time. But what I actually want to learn would cost me a fortune. I want to learn QinQ, LACP over fibre or DAC coper cables, spine and leaf. This is high performance datacentre stuff and cost a lot of money.\nBut you can still learn some basics at home with few managed layer 3 switches.\nTings to learn: VLANs. If lucky, SFP modules.\nPatch panels I suppose you should learn it. Patch panels offer basic structured cabling. It is quite important to understand how to organise cables, it is easy to neglect it and very soon it will become a spaghetti nightmare. Lern it, tick the box. Done.\nPersonally, I have done it and would avoid. I have worked with some horrible RJ45 patch panels before, keystones fall back to 10Mbit/100Mbit or even stop working.\nGet the patch panel with punch at the back. These are less flexible but stable.\nIn datacentres I would try to use DAC or fibre with TOR switches. Server to switch. Do not bother with patch panels too much.\nStorage I am not big on the storage. I actually have enterprise storage such as HP MSA. Why? Just had a bad experience. And they are insanely expensive. If it was me, I would setup something like ZFS and use consumer grade NVME, or other opensource linux storage system. You can even setup the replication and deduplication. This is fun. I will do this whenever I have the opportunity. TODO.\nOther kind of homelab Get few raspberry pi’s and cheap L2 switch, or a small factor PC, such as old Ubiquity NVR or small lenovo the size of a pencil. Those are fun and don’t take much space or electricity.\nConclusion Homelab can be fun but expensive and takes space. It has its limits especially datacentre networking or storage requires big investment. For small things like virtualisation or you could use a desktop computer. But it gets more expensive when you want to setup a production grade cluster for virtualisation.\n","wordCount":"752","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-10-23T11:00:19+01:00","dateModified":"2022-10-23T11:00:19+01:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://invizus.github.io/posts/why-no-homelab/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Roman - sysadmin experience","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://invizus.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://invizus.github.io accesskey=h title="Roman - sysadmin experience (Alt + H)">Roman - sysadmin experience</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://invizus.github.io/about/ title="About me"><span>About me</span></a></li><li><a href=https://invizus.github.io/motivate/ title="Motivate yourself"><span>Motivate yourself</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>Thoughts on having my own homelab</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-10-23 11:00:19 +0100 +0100'>October 23, 2022</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Have you even been browsing /r/homelab on reddit?
