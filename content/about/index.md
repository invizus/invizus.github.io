Hi there. I am Linux system admin, DYI beginner and as much as I hate
talking about food, I like to cook and try new things. I also read sometimes,
I read normal books, a bit about science and sometimes blog posts.

## Tech
I administer Linux and I think Linux is great for scripting, automating things,
doing infrastructure as code. So that is what I do.
- Linux
- Ansible, Terraform
- AWS, GCP

Then I like doing observability and security:
- Firewalls, iptables/nftables
- Elasticsearch/elastalert
- prometheus, grafana
- VPN

Obviously, also:
- git, LAMP stack, python

As a sysadmin I also have (and like) to administer server hardware, document things.
Netowrking (switches, firewalls, vlans). I have designed and setup datacentre
infrastructure as well.

## Personal life
I happen to have interests outsife of computers too.

Fancy knives and pans for cooking? Check. Does food come tasty? Well, ask my wife, she
does not go to kitchen often! :D

Fixing and riding my bicycle. Just a training for a sportbike.

Various tastes in music. IDM, pop, metal, rave. I don't care.

I like DYI same way I like writing my scripts. Sometimes... finished.

Did I say I read? I mean, normal books, also sometimes articles about space and science.

I am always open to new things.
